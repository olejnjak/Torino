# Torino

Torino is a caching tool for XCFrameworks built by [Carthage][carthage]. Torino is considered an evolution to [Rome][rome] as its features are heavily inspired for its past usage. Also big credit goes to [@LukasHromadnik](https://github.com/LukasHromadnik) as quite a lot of code was based on his private work.

**⚠️ Torino is in early alpha so you should not rely on it yet**

## Installation

The simplest usage is to use [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint), just add Torino to your Mintfile and you are ready to go.

```
olejnjak/Torino@main
```

## Usage

Torino currently supports only `download` and `upload` commands that both take a single `--prefix` parameter that is used for caching binaries with correct Swift version.

## Naming 

If you wonder why is Torino named after this Italian 🇮🇹  city, it is quite simple. As it works on top of [Carthage 🇹🇳][carthage] and is inspired by [Rome 🇮🇹][rome] and I am a fan of Juventus FC 🖤🤍 it was quite natural to name it this way 😎
